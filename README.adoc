System Emergency Room (A&E) is the **panic-safe intake** for the AmbientOps ecosystem.

When a user is overwhelmed, scared, or in a suspected incident, A&E provides:
evidence capture, safety posture toggles, and calm handoff to the right next step.

[IMPORTANT]
====
*Project status:* *Specification Pending*

This repository may currently contain scaffolding only.
Implementation and detailed specifications will land next.
====

== What it is

A&E is a *single-click* entry point available from:

* start menu / launcher
* desktop shortcut (optional)
* file manager context menu (optional)
* Ward tray menu (“I need help now”)

== What it does (design intent)

1. **Stabilise**
   * reduce risk of making things worse
   * offer optional “safety posture” toggles (non-destructive defaults)

2. **Capture**
   * create an incident bundle (evidence envelope + artifacts)
   * record what the user observed in plain language prompts

3. **Handoff**
   * to Ward (“keep calm; here is the next step”)
   * to Operating Theatre (scan/plan for a targeted issue)
   * to PSA (clinician workflow, if enabled)
   * to Records/feedback-a-tron (share bundle, redacted)

== Safety rules

* Default actions must be **non-destructive**.
* No silent “repairs”.
* Any change must be explicit, logged, and preferably reversible.
* Incident bundles must be local-first; sharing is opt-in.

== Incident bundle outputs

A&E produces artifacts defined in `system-tools-contracts`:

* Evidence Envelope (metadata + references)
* Run Bundle layout (standard folder structure)
* Optional “Vitals Summary” import/export hooks for Systems Observatory

== Integrations (planned)

* Ward: deep-link back with a calm status + next step
* Operating Theatre: create scan/plan request with constraints
* Systems Observatory: request a “context window” summary
* feedback-a-tron: create a redaction-aware message intent
* HAR: policy-gated execution only (if enabled)

== Profiles

A&E respects profile gates:

* General users: minimal, calm language; safe defaults
* Developer/Technician: more detail available, but not forced
* Child profile: proactive safety prompts and simplified choices

== Roadmap

See `ROADMAP.adoc`.
